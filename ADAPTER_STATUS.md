# Recursica vs. MUI Component Map

_Last updated: 2026-09-02_

<!-- recursica:meta adapter="mui" -->

## What this document is

This is the **adapter status document** for `@recursica/adapter-mui-v7` — the source of truth for
how this adapter's Recursica components relate to the underlying MUI UI kit (`@mui/material`,
plus its `@mui/lab`/`@mui/x-date-pickers`/`@mui/x-tree-view` peers) it wraps. It exists so
engineers and [Recursica.com](https://recursica.com)'s automated pipeline share one structured
answer to four questions:

1. Which Recursica components map directly onto an MUI component, and what that mapping is.
2. Which Recursica components have no usable MUI equivalent and are hand-built instead.
3. Which MUI components/exports this adapter styles internally with Recursica design tokens
   without exposing them as a first-class Recursica component.
4. Which MUI components have no Recursica equivalent at all, and why.

[Recursica.com](https://recursica.com) parses this file directly to render this adapter's
component-coverage page — it should be kept current whenever this adapter's component set changes.

## Format, for parsers

This file is both human-readable Markdown and machine-parsable. Everything a parser needs is
delimited by HTML comments, which render invisibly wherever this file is viewed as Markdown
(GitHub, Storybook docs, recursica.com, etc.):

- **Document metadata**: a single `<!-- recursica:meta adapter="..." -->` comment right below the
  title, carrying `adapter` (this adapter's short name). Which kit(s) it wraps and their exact
  versions aren't repeated here — that's already in this repo's own `package.json` dependencies,
  and the kit name is in the title and prose below; duplicating it in the meta comment would just
  be another place for it to drift out of sync.
- **Structured tables**: each of the 4 categories above is wrapped in a matched pair of markers —

  ```
  <!-- recursica:table id="..." -->
  | Column A | Column B |
  |---|---|
  | ... | ... |
  <!-- /recursica:table -->
  ```

  `id` is always exactly one of 4 fixed values, each present exactly once, in any order:
  `direct-mappings`, `hand-built`, `internal-only`, `unsupported`. Every table is exactly 2
  columns — a component name, then a description — standard GFM table syntax (header row, `---`
  separator row, one data row per line). Extract a table by matching its marker pair and feeding
  the content between them to any GFM table parser.

- **Everything else** — prose, headings, footnotes, "near-miss"/"not in this category" callouts —
  is human context only, not structured data. A parser should ignore anything outside the marker
  pairs.

This shape is enforced automatically: `npm run validate-adapter-status` (wired into both this
repo's pre-commit hook and CI) fails if the meta comment, table ids, or table shape don't match
this spec.

## Methodology

Source: `@recursica/adapter-mui-v7` (`src/components/*`) cross-checked against the actual
`@mui/material@7.3.11` package contents (the hoisted version resolving the adapter's
`"@mui/material": "^7.3.0"` peer dependency), plus the adapter's three optional MUI peer
packages where individual components pull from them: `@mui/lab@7.0.1-beta.25` (Tabs, Timeline),
`@mui/x-date-pickers@9.11.0` (DatePicker, TimePicker), and `@mui/x-tree-view@9.11.0` (Tree).
`@mui/icons-material` is **not** a dependency at all — every icon in this adapter is a
hand-drawn inline SVG, not an MUI icon import.

Every mapping below was confirmed by reading each component's actual `.tsx` source and import
statements (not single-line grep — files were read in full, since several components compose
MUI pieces deep in the JSX body, not just in the top import block), cross-checked against
`@mui/material`'s real `index.js` export list. `Layer` and `RecursicaThemeProvider` are excluded
below — both are defined once in `@recursica/adapter-common` and merely re-exported here with no
MUI-specific implementation of their own.

## 1. Recursica components that map directly to a MUI component

<!-- recursica:table id="direct-mappings" -->

| Recursica component | MUI equivalent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Accordion           | `Accordion` + `AccordionSummary` + `AccordionDetails` (the outer multi-panel group/context is hand-built — MUI's own `Accordion` is a single controlled item with no group concept)                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Card                | `Card` (MUI's `Paper`-based component) — but `Card.Section`/`Header`/`Footer`/`Content` sub-parts are hand-built `<div>`s, not MUI Card sub-components                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Group               | `Stack` (forced to `direction="row"`; MUI has no native `Group`, so this recreates Mantine's `Group` shape on top of `Stack`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Heading             | wraps Recursica's own `Typography` wrapper (which itself wraps MUI `Typography`), rendered as `h1`–`h6` per `order`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

<!-- /recursica:table -->

**Naming-mismatch notes worth flagging explicitly** (confirmed by reading source, not guessable from names):

- **Recursica's `TextField` does not wrap MUI's `TextField`.** It wraps the lower-level
  `InputBase` directly. Meanwhile MUI's real `TextField` component _is_ used elsewhere in the
  adapter — internally, inside `AutoComplete`'s `renderInput` (see §3).
- **Recursica's `Popover` and `HoverCard` both wrap MUI's `Tooltip`**, just in two different
  interaction modes (click-controlled vs. hover-controlled). Neither wraps MUI's real `Popover`
  component, which goes entirely unused by this adapter (see §4).
- **Recursica's `Toast` wraps MUI's `Alert`**, not MUI's `Snackbar`/`SnackbarContent` (the
  components MUI itself designates for toast-style notifications). `Snackbar` is unused (§4).
- **Recursica's `Modal` wraps MUI's `Dialog`**, not MUI's lower-level `Modal` primitive that
  `Dialog` itself is built on. The low-level `Modal` export is unused directly (§4).

## 2. Recursica components with no usable MUI equivalent (hand-built)

These have no MUI component to wrap at all (verified: no `@mui/material`/`@mui/lab`/`@mui/x-*`
import of any kind in the file), or only use an MUI primitive (`Box`) purely for generic layout
styling rather than as a functional widget:

| Recursica component | Why                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FileInput           | No MUI file-upload/dropzone component with an externally-controlled `files` contract; hand-built from a plain `<div role="button">` with native drag/drop handlers and a hidden native `<input type="file">`, composed from Recursica's own `Button`/`Chip`/`FormControlWrapper`. Zero `@mui/material` imports.                                                                                                                 |
| FileUpload          | Same hand-built dropzone pattern and same rationale as FileInput — no MUI file-upload component to lean on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| FormControlLayout   | Recursica-specific label/field/assistive-text two-column composition primitive; purely `<div>`s + CSS Modules, no MUI concept matches this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Loader              | No MUI spinner is used at all (not even `CircularProgress`) — entirely hand-built from a `<span>` driven by `data-variant`/`data-size` CSS attributes; "bars"/"dots" variants render plain `<span>` children for CSS-driven animation.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ReadOnlyField       | No MUI read-only-value/read-only-branching primitive exists. Root renders a plain `<p>`; sibling files (`ReadOnlyBooleanField`, `ReadOnlySwitchField`, `ReadOnlyTextField`) only import MUI's `Box` for generic flex layout (`component="span"`/`"p"`), not as a functional control. `WithReadOnlyWrapper` (the active/read-only dispatcher used by NumberInput, Radio.Group, Slider, Switch.Group, etc.) is likewise MUI-free. |
| TransferList        | No MUI dual-list-box component. Hand-built from raw `<div>`s, composed entirely from Recursica's own `Badge`/`Button`/`TextField`/`Checkbox`/`Checkbox.Group` (any MUI usage is inherited indirectly through those). Zero direct `@mui/material` imports — the clearest "no MUI at all" case in the adapter.                                                                                                                    |

## 3. Additional MUI components/exports that this adapter styles/themes with Recursica tokens but does NOT expose as a first-class Recursica component

Used as internal implementation details of another Recursica component — never exposed as a
standalone Recursica component in their own right:

Ironically, the Recursica component literally named `TextField` doesn't use it (see naming-mismatch note in §1).                                                  |
| `Box`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Beyond being the direct basis of `Flex` (§1), also used purely as a generic layout `<span>`/`<p>` substitute inside `ReadOnlyBooleanField`/`ReadOnlySwitchField`/`ReadOnlyTextField`.                                               |
| `Popper` (via `slotProps.popper`)                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `HoverCard`, `Popover`, `AutoComplete`, and `Dropdown` all configure Popper-level positioning (margins, modifiers) through `slotProps.popper` on their host component; `Popper` itself is never imported as a standalone component. |

## 4. MUI components with no Recursica equivalent

Widget-level, user-facing exports in `@mui/material@7.3.11`'s public surface
(`index.js`'s `_exportNames`) that nothing in Recursica's component set maps to at all — either
because no Recursica component covers that use case, or because the closest-sounding Recursica
component was confirmed (by reading its source) to wrap something else entirely. Pure
utility/hook exports (`colors`, `useMediaQuery`, `usePagination`, `useScrollTrigger`,
`useAutocomplete`, `GlobalStyles`, `unstable_composeClasses`, `generateUtilityClass(es)`,
`Unstable_TrapFocus`, `InitColorSchemeScript`, `darkScrollbar`) are excluded as non-components.
