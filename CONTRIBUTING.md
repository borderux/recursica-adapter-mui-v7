STOP AND READ THIS FIRST.
If you are an AI agent tasked with creating or modifying a component:

1. You MUST wrap the component props with `RecursicaOverStyled`.
2. You MUST NOT use hardcoded colors or sizing (e.g. padding="16px"). You must use the CSS variables from `recursica_variables_scoped.css`.
3. If you do not see a relevant CSS variable in the design tokens, you must inform the developer and PAUSE implementation.
4. You MUST read `docs/COMPONENT_DEV_GUIDE.md` for specific implementation constraints.

# Contributing to the MUI Adapter

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Recursica! It's people like you that make our community great. We welcome contributions of all kinds, from reporting bugs and suggesting enhancements to submitting pull requests for code changes or documentation improvements.

## 🤖 Instructions for AI Agents & Developers Building Components

If you are tasked with building, modifying, or reviewing components **inside** the `mui-adapter`, you must strictly adhere to our architectural philosophy and design constraints.

**DO NOT** begin writing or modifying component code until you have read and understood the following core documents:

1. **Core Philosophy:** Read `docs/PHILOSOPHY.md` to understand why we aggressively block arbitrary styling, how we use the `overStyled` property, and why we never modify MUI natively.
2. **Component Implementation:** Read `docs/COMPONENT_DEV_GUIDE.md` for the exact rules on structuring scoped CSS, filtering styling props, and building naked component wrappers. **Do not duplicate those rules here; follow them directly from the guide.**
3. **Storybook Requirements:** Read `docs/COMPONENT_STORYBOOK_GUIDE.md`. **Rule:** You must implement a Storybook story for every new component or variant you build. Verification is required.
4. **Public Usage Documentation:** Every component MUST have a `USAGE.md` file living within its component folder (e.g., `src/components/Button/USAGE.md`) that documents how to import and use the component, highlighting any adapter-specific behaviors, layout constraints, and accessibility requirements. This is the main public integration reference.
5. **Internal Implementation Notes:** Every component MUST have its own `[COMPONENT]_IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` file (or `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`) living within its component folder (e.g., `src/components/Button/IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` or `BUTTON_IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`) to document internal engineering decisions, layout hacks, and CSS workarounds. This file is for internal technical tracking and is not publicly consumable.
6. **Update `llms.txt`:** Whenever you add a new component (or rename/remove one), update the package's root `llms.txt` to keep its "Components" list in sync — add a link to the new component's `USAGE.md` (e.g., `- [Button](src/components/Button/USAGE.md)`) in alphabetical order. `llms.txt` is the entry point external AI agents use to discover components, so a missing entry means that component is effectively invisible to them.

## Visual Regression Testing

This adapter runs `@recursica/adapter-tester` in default mode — its `test/golden/` images are checked for own-drift and flagged (never failed) for divergence from `@recursica/mantine-adapter`'s golden baseline. See [`packages/adapter-tester/README.md`](../adapter-tester/README.md) and [`packages/adapter-tester/AGENT.md`](../adapter-tester/AGENT.md) for the full workflow, thresholds, and exemption rules; don't duplicate them here.

## Keeping Shared Docs in Sync

This adapter's `docs/COMPONENT_DEV_GUIDE.md` and `docs/COMPONENT_STORYBOOK_GUIDE.md` are **thin, MUI-specific deltas** — the full canonical rule set lives in [`packages/adapter-common/docs/`](../adapter-common/docs/). If you're changing a rule that applies to every adapter (not just this one), edit the canonical doc in `adapter-common/docs/`, not this adapter's delta — and check whether `mantine-adapter`'s delta doc needs a corresponding update. Only edit this adapter's own `docs/COMPONENT_DEV_GUIDE.md`/`docs/COMPONENT_STORYBOOK_GUIDE.md` for something genuinely specific to MUI.

`docs/PHILOSOPHY.md` is different: it's a **full, self-contained, published** document (it's in this package's `"files"` array, unlike the two docs above), because it explains consumer-relevant behavior, not just contributor process. It does **not** link to a canonical doc anywhere. If you change something in it that reflects a philosophy shared by every adapter — not something genuinely specific to MUI — go check whether `mantine-adapter/docs/PHILOSOPHY.md` needs the equivalent change too. There's no automated or structural check for this; it's a manual discipline documented in `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STRATEGY.md` §4.

See [`packages/adapter-common/docs/PIPELINE.md`](../adapter-common/docs/PIPELINE.md) for how doc and code changes flow across `adapter-common` → this adapter → `storybook-template` → `recursica-storybook`.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. The information you provide helps us resolve issues faster.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement to an existing one, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. Describe your idea in as much detail as possible.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking for issues tagged as `good first issue` or `help wanted`.

### Pull Request Process

We welcome your pull requests. Please follow these steps:

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  Make your changes in a new git branch.
3.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`).
5.  Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint`).
6.  If your change affects the user (e.g., adds a feature, fixes a bug), you **must** add a changeset. See the section below.
7.  Issue that pull request!

## Using Changesets

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage releases. All pull requests that fix a bug, add a feature, or otherwise impact the user must include a changeset file.

To create a changeset, run the following command in the root of the project:

```sh
npx changeset
```

This will launch an interactive CLI that will guide you through creating a changeset. You will be asked to:

- Select which packages have changed.
- Provide a version type for each package (`patch`, `minor`, or `major`).
- Write a summary of the change.

**Keep the summary to a maximum of 2 lines.** Changesets feed directly into the published CHANGELOG; long, detailed writeups belong in the PR description or commit message, not the changeset file.

Commit the generated changeset file along with your other changes. When your pull request is merged, our release workflow will use this information to automatically version, create changelogs, and publish the packages.
