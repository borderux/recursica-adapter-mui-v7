# TransferList Implementation Notes

## Architecture overview

`TransferList` replaces the "coming soon" stub with a fully custom composite — neither
`@mantine/core` nor `@mui/material` ships a real dual-listbox component (MUI's docs "Transfer
List" is a List+Checkbox recipe, not a package export), so it's built from Recursica's own
primitives, the same situation `FileUpload`/`FileInput` were in.

Follows Matt's reference implementation (Forge's fallback `TransferList.tsx`) fairly closely:

- Two side-by-side panes (source/target), each: a header row (pane label + `Badge` count,
  `"selected / total"` once something's checked), a search `TextField`, then a scrollable list of
  `Checkbox` rows (`CheckboxGroup` for items carrying a `group` field).
- A column of four transfer `Button`s between the panes: single/double chevron, each direction —
  single moves only the checked items in that pane, double moves everything in that pane.
- Data model: `data`/`defaultData` as a `[sourceItems, targetItems]` tuple + `onChange`, matching
  Forge's controlled/uncontrolled pattern (same shape as `FileUpload`'s `files`/`onFilesAdded`).

## Routed through `FormControlWrapper` directly, not Forge's hand-rolled label/assistive

Forge's reference renders its own `Label`/`AssistiveElement` directly instead of going through
`FormControlWrapper`. Per direction, this build uses `FormControlWrapper` instead — consistent
with every other form control in this codebase (and with `FileUpload`, which was reverted to
`FormControlWrapper` rather than hand-rolling that same thing). `formLayout`
(`stacked`/`side-by-side`), `label`, `required`, `assistiveText`/`description`/`helperText`, and
`error` all come from the standard wrapper; only the two panes + transfer buttons are the
component's own content.

## `state` axis: `disabled`/`error` props, not Forge's `state` string

Forge's reference takes a single `state="default"|"disabled"|"error"` prop. This build instead
uses the same convention as every other Recursica control: a boolean `disabled` prop plus
`FormControlWrapper`'s own `error` (message) prop — `error`'s mere presence is what triggers the
error visuals, exactly like `TextArea`/`CheckboxGroup`. The token export only defines
`disabled`/`error` state variants (no `focus`), matching Matt's direction to "follow the tokens."

## `readOnly` mode (added 2026-08-19)

Forge's reference has no read-only concept, but Matt asked for a `ReadOnly` story demonstrating
the selected items as a read-only list. Switched from calling `FormControlWrapper` directly to
routing through `WithReadOnlyWrapper` (the follow-up flagged in the original version of this note),
matching `TextArea`'s shape: `readOnly`/`readOnlyComponent`/`emptyValueComponent` added to the prop
surface via `ReadOnlyControlProps`, `readOnlyType="text"`, and `readOnlyValue` set to the target
pane's item labels (`effectiveData[1].map(item => item.label)`). Renders as a comma-joined text
list via the shared `ReadOnlyTextField`, same convention `CheckboxGroup`'s own read-only mode
already uses for an array of values — no new read-only renderer needed. The two panes + transfer
buttons (`activeComponent`) are skipped entirely when `readOnly` is set, same as every other
control.

## Height/gap/padding token audit (2026-08-19)

Matt flagged the pane height as "too short" and asked that gap/padding be tied to recursica
variables. Re-verified against `recursica_variables_scoped.css`: `properties_height` (200px),
`properties_width`, `properties_vertical-padding`/`properties_horizontal-padding`, and
`properties_gap` were already wired to their tokens (see "Token interpretation" above) — the 200px
pane height is the design token's own value, not a hardcoded fallback. Two spacing values genuinely
have no covering token in the 31-variable schema and are intentionally left as hardcoded pixels
(see `TransferList.module.css` comments) rather than reusing another component's token: the gap
between stacked `CheckboxGroup` blocks in `.paneList` (ungrouped row + each named group), and the
gap between the four transfer buttons in `.transferColumn`. If a token is added to the schema for
either, wire it in directly; until then this matches the established precedent (e.g. `FileUpload`'s
untokened icon size) of leaving a truly uncovered value hardcoded with a documented reason instead
of borrowing a sibling component's namespace.

## Fixed: checkboxes inside `CheckboxGroup` ignored their own `checked`/`onChange` (2026-08-19)

Matt's discrepancy report against the mantine source of truth: clicking an ungrouped checkbox in
the `Grouped` story showed no checkmark and never toggled selection, though the pane's `Badge`
count also never changed — meaning it silently did nothing, not "count going up" as literally
worded, confirmed live via Playwright against both Storybooks (`isChecked()` stayed `false`, badge
text stayed `5` across repeated clicks in mui; mantine correctly showed `1 / 5`, `2 / 5`).

Root cause was in `Checkbox.tsx`, not `TransferList.tsx`: `TransferList` wraps its ungrouped items
in a bare `<CheckboxGroup>` purely so they pick up the `item-gap` layout token (see the
`RECURSICA_COMPONENTS`/gap fix from 2026-08-18), without ever passing that group a `value`/
`onChange`. But `Checkbox.tsx` derived `isGrouped` from `groupContext !== null` alone — any
`CheckboxGroup` ancestor forced grouped-array semantics (`isChecked = groupContext.value.includes(...)`,
`handleChange` dispatching to `groupContext.onChange` instead of the checkbox's own `onChange`),
even though the group had no `value` array and no `onChange` to dispatch to. `TransferList`'s own
`checked={selected.has(item.value)}`/`onChange={() => onToggle(item.value)}` props were present but
silently overridden/ignored. Mantine's `Checkbox.tsx` never had this bug — it doesn't consult any
group context at all and always passes `checked`/`onChange` straight through to
`@mantine/core`'s `Checkbox`.

Fixed by only treating a `Checkbox` as group-controlled when it _doesn't_ already have its own
explicit `checked` prop: `isGrouped = groupContext !== null && restRecord.checked === undefined`.
A checkbox with its own `checked` (like `TransferList`'s rows) now always owns its source of truth;
only checkboxes relying on `Checkbox.Group`'s array-tracking (no individual `checked`, matched by
`value` — `CheckboxGroup.stories.tsx`'s usage) still defer to the group. Audited every
`CheckboxGroup`/`Checkbox` pairing in mui-adapter (`CheckboxGroup.stories.tsx` and `TransferList`) —
no existing usage combines both an individual `checked` and group-array `value`, so this is a
straight bug fix with no regression risk.

## Token interpretation: unlabeled tokens with more than one plausible layout target

The 31-variable schema (`properties_*` + two `layouts.*` + `states.{disabled,error}`) has a few
names that don't pin down a single location by themselves:

- **`properties_gap`** — applied to the row holding `[source pane, transfer column, target pane]`.
  It's the only _unnested_ gap the schema defines at the component's own level (not under
  `header-style`, a state, or a layout), so it reads as the component's top-level layout gap.
- **`properties_title-filter-gap`** — between each pane's header row (label + count `Badge`) and
  its search field.
- **`properties_filter-items-gap`** — between each pane's search field and its item list.
- **`properties_header-style_*` / `properties_colors_header-color`** — typography/color for each
  pane's own header text, not the overall `FormControlWrapper` label (which has its own type
  styling already).
- **`properties_width` (300px) / `properties_height` (200px)** — taken as each pane's own fixed
  box size (`flex: 1 1 <width>`, so panes still stretch evenly in a wider container; `height` is
  literal since a dual-listbox needs a bounded, independently-scrollable list).

No exemptions needed beyond `border-size` (see below) — all 31 variables are referenced; verified
zero broken/unused via `recursica-token-analyzer`.

## Border-size intentionally unused

Same house policy `TextField`/`TextArea`/`FileInput` already follow: `border-size` (base,
`disabled`, `error`) is `recursica-ignore`d and a flat 1px border is applied uniformly instead, so
switching states doesn't shift layout.

## No forge-defined focus state

`transfer-list` has no `states.focus` axis in the export — same as `FileInput`/`TextField`. Focus
is handled per-control (each `Checkbox`/`TextField`/`Button` already has its own focus ring); the
pane box itself has no focus state to render.

## Grouping and search are local, not per-item persisted state

Search filters each pane independently (`sourceSearch`/`targetSearch`); grouped items render under
a `CheckboxGroup` keyed by `item.group`, ungrouped items render as plain `Checkbox` rows above the
groups (alphabetized by group name) — same two-bucket split Forge's reference uses. Selection
(`sourceSelected`/`targetSelected`) is cleared on every transfer, matching Forge's behavior.

## Chevron icons are inline, not a shared icon set entry

Same precedent as `Tree`'s `ExpandGlyph`/`FileInput`'s `ClearIcon`: a single-chevron and a
double-chevron SVG are defined locally and flipped via `transform: scaleX(-1)` for the "left"
direction, rather than maintaining four separate paths or adding new shared icon-set entries for a
single component.
